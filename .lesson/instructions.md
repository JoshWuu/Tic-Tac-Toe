## Before Starting This Task

**It's recommended that you only begin this task if you have already submitted Exercises 2.1 to 2.8.** It's okay if you are waiting for some of them to be marked.

## Grading

The **Project 2 Self-Evaluation** is posted on Google Classroom.

## Project: Human vs. Bot Game

This is your second long-term project. You will be creating a two-player game (a user against a computer) in which the user interacts with the console *or* with a Turtle window. The computer can either play/make moves at random or incorporate some sort of strategy.

### Step 1: Choose your game.

Some suggestions include:
* [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
* [Dot and Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes)
* [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))
* [Farkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle)

If you are choosing a different type of game, be sure to check with your teacher first.

### Step 2: Plan your game.

Answer the following questions.

1. How does your game work?
2. How long do you think it will take to write all the code for this game?
3. What do you think will be the most challenging part of creating this game?
4. If you happen to finish early, what other features could you try to add to the game to make it better?

### Step 3: Begin coding your game.

Begin writing the code for your game in **main.py**. Ensure that your program has line comments to explain your thinking and your code includes ALL of the following:

* `print()`
* `input()`
* `if`
* `def`
* a loop
* a list or a tuple

Whenever you use `def` to make a custom function, be sure to document it using a docstring.

Optional: 
* If you are using the `curses` library you don't need to include `print()` and `input()`.

### Step 4: Test your game.

You will be assigned a classmate who will test out your game and give you feedback. You will also test our their game and give them feedback.

When giving feedback, you are encouraged to answer the following prompts:

* What parts of the program/game were done well?
* What parts of the program/game could use improvement?
* What do you wish the program/game included?

Modify your code based on their feedback.

### Step 5: Acknowledge your sources.

In **sources.md**, put links to ALL of the online resources you used. In your program, be sure you have line comments to indicate which parts of your program are copy/pasted from the Internet.

### Step 6: Reflection.

Answer all of the following questions.

1. What did you enjoy about this project?

2. What did you not enjoy about this project?

3. Describe some of the strategies you used to overcome challenges and difficulties when writing your program.

4. Were there any features you planned on including but eventually decided not to include? If so, what were they?

5. If you were to redo this project, what would you do differently?

6. If you had more experience programming, what would you do to make this game better?

7. Would you like to come back to this project later? Why or why not?
